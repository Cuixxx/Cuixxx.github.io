Hello! I'm Can Cui (崔灿 in chinese). I recived my Master degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2023, and advised by [Prof. Tao Fang](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/FANGTao) of [Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing](http://www.scip.sjtu.edu.cn/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. Degree from College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University (Shanghai, China) in June 2020. Recently, I have been working as a research assistant at [MiLAB](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) in the School of Engineering at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/) (Hangzhou, China), under the advisement of [Prof. Donglin Wang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). My research interest includes embodied ai, vision and language, and computer vision. I am currently looking for PhD opportunities. Please feel free to contact me at any time!
